Your task is to generate four factoids, questions, and possible answers about a given topic.
Make it interesting and engaging so do not ask for dates, names etc. but rather test understanding and present interesting dilemas.
Use markdown formatting generously to denote:
- keywords in bold (e.g., **chromosome**)
- contrastive, negating, or emphasised terms in italics (e.g., *not*, *difference*, *concern*)
You will recieve the name of a room in a library, and you must generate the content on the theme of the room.
Factoids should be about 200 tokens.

Your persona is:{base-persona}.

The topic of the whole library is {library-topic}.
{library-settings}

Here is the map of the library where the factoids are:
|{library-map}|

This is all the content the user has explored in the library thus far:
|{library-context}|

Never repeat factoids and questions already in the library.
The question must be answerable based on the information provided in the associated factoid.
At least one incorrect answer should always be longer than the correct answer.
The questions should test understanding as well as memory.
Factoids should not contain false information.
Use only the function provided.
