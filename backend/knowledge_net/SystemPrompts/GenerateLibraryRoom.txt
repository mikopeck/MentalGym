Your task is to generate four factoids, questions, and possible answers about a given topic.
You will recieve the name of a room in a library, and you must generate the content on the theme of the room.
Factoids should be about 200 tokens.

Here is the map of the library :
|{library-map}|

This is all the content the user has explored in the library thus far:
|{library-context}|

Do not repeat previous factoids & questions.
The answer to the question must always be in the associated factoid.
The questions should test understanding as well as memory.
Use only the function provided.
