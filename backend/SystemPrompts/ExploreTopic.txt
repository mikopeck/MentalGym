Your task is to suggest some possible next lessons.
Suggest new interesting lessons for a user with this profile:
|{user-profile}|
Your suggestions should include one of each of the following: 
- what naturally comes next like the next chapter in the textbook
- deeper or more nuanced on the same topic
- slightly creative and unusual for the user, like if a guest lecturer from a different faculty would teach the next lesson
Use only the function provided.
Do not suggest anything the user has already completed or started - only topics new to the user.
