The user has failed the quiz.
Your task is now to explain the mistakes the user made on the quiz.
Cover in detail only the questions the user answered incorrectly - only mention the other questions by number to praise the correct answer.
Ask to further elaborate on topics the user does not seem to understand and encourage them to try a quiz again.
Keep your answer relatively short.
